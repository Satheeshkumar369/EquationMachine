Quantum simulation of hydrogen ground state energy using the ibm python library [```qiskit_nature```]  to simulate it in a ibm quantum computer

* ```MolecularHamiltonian.ipynb``` - This notebook demonstrates how the hamiltonian of the molecule are obtained from the quantum simulation.
* ```Energy_Spectrum_1.ipynb``` - This notebook contain the obtained hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule by varying their interatomic distances.
